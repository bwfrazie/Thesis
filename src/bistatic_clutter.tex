\section{Bistatic Clutter Impacts}

As previously discussed, the Signal to Clutter Ratio (SCR) is a valuable metric that determines the observability of a target against the background. Clutter is very well understood for monostatic geometries but still an active area of research for bistatic geometries.

\subsection {Bistatic Clutter Estimation}
Because the RCS varies by target and both signal and clutter are captured under the same conditions, we can focus on the Clutter Cross Section (CCS) to get a relative sense of how background clutter relates to bistatic RADAR.

We can use Long's model to determine the cross range clutter backscatter term, $\sigma_{Mx}^0$. This term is dependent on wind speed, $v_w$ and wind direction, $\phi_w$.
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{Mx}^0 = 29.8\log\left(0.5144 v_w\right) + 6\cos\left(\phi_w \right) -84.7
\label{bc_eq:1}
\end{equation}

We can then use $\sigma_{Mx}^0$ to find the bistatic clutter backscatter strength, $\sigma_{B}^0$
\begin{equation}
\sigma_B^0 = 10\log\left[\sqrt{\sigma_M^0(\theta_1,0)\sigma_M^0(\theta_2,\phi)} |\cos(\phi)|^m  + k\sqrt{\sigma_{Mx}^0(\theta_1,0)\sigma_{Mx}^0(\theta_2,\phi)}|\sin(\phi)|^n \right]
\label{bc_eq:2}
\end{equation}
\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{2} \small\normalsize

Here, $\theta_1$ is the grazing angle relative to the receiver, $\theta_2$ is the grazing angle relative to the transmitter, $phi$ is the azimuth angle between the receiver and transmitter, $\sigma_M^0$ is the monostatic clutter backscatter strength. In addition, $k$, $m$, and $n$ are model "fudge-factors" that must all be positive. The $\cos(\phi)$ term captures the downrange component and the $\sin(\phi)$ term captures the cross range component.
