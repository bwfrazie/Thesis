\chapter{Random Matrix Theory Overview}
Eugene Wigner developed Random Matrix Theory (RMT) to describe the statistics of energy levels of large nuclei. He found that if he replaced the Hamiltonian of the systems with a random matrix, the statistical properties of the eigenvalues were in agreement (provided the random matrix was chosen from an appropriate distribution).

Since then, RMT has become extremely useful in characterizing chaotic systems that are extremely complicated and highly sensitive to small changes.
